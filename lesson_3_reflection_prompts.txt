When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	It is safer to have a remote repository in the sense that it is a second copy. Also, using GitHub means that there is a place accessible at anytime, for the other members of the team, to clone or pull. The no-good part is that GitHub is a private company, their servers are their servers, not the ones of the client company, so at the end of the day it is about trust in GitHub that they will never steal or get stolen the info we store on their servers.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Doing it manually means keeping more control. For example if I was working on something on a branch, on someone else worked too on the same branch, we might want to wait until we reach a point where it makes sense to share and merge the branches.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	Fork is a GitHub only concept. It is a clone referring to the original git version, but on which you have no impact or permissions.
	Clone is doing an identical copy of a first version, with which you can copy again to keep them even after one or the other has made changes.
	A branch happens within a git, inside the project, it is a slightly different version to work on bt keeping a link with the others.


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
	
	This way we can view the diff anytime we want, without affecting our work. We can see how it differs, and we can even work on merging them.

What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	When I initialize a repository Git installes his hidden tracking file, but it does NOT create a commit automatically yet.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	The staging area is an intermediate state, where the files we put there are already under the focus of Git status, but they are not commit yet.
